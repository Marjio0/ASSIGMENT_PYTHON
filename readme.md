## Containerization Assigment

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- Docker
- Minikube
- kubectl

### Architecture information

#### Docker container 1

A container that exposes an endpoint that returns the string "Hello, World!" and another one to ask the Container 2 to greet the user

#### Docker container 2

A container that exposes an endpoint that returns the string "Hello, Docker!" and another one to ask the Container 1 to greet the user

### Description

Two docker services are created and orchestrated by docker-compose on a first layer. Then, these two services are pushed to Docker-hub on the following urls:

1. https://hub.docker.com/r/marjio0/app-world
2. https://hub.docker.com/r/marjio0/app-docker

Then, using these two images, we can deploy on a kubernetes cluster and perform requests on the two services.

These two services can perform two jobs. The first is to greet the user and ask the other one to greet the user.

Available routes:

1. {endpoint1}/say-hello-docker **(Expected: Hello, Docker!)**
2. {endpoint2}/say-hello-world **(Expected: Hello, World!)**
3. {endpoint1}/hello-to-world-app **(Expected: Received response from app-docker: Hello, World!)**
4. {endpoint2}/hello-to-docker-app **(Expected: Received response from app-hello: Hello, Docker!)**

Note that the final endpoints should be generated by the following commands:

```bash
minikube service app-world-service
minikube service app-docker-service
```

### Installation & Execution

#### 1. Start minikube

```bash
minikube start --memory 4096 --cpus 2
```

#### 2. Docker Images

The Docker images for app-world and app-docker should be available on Docker Hub

#### 3. Deploy the Applications

The kubernetes configuration files are located inside k8s directory on this repository and are the following:

1. _app-world-deployment.yaml_
2. _app-world-service.yaml_
3. _app-docker-deployment.yaml_
4. _app-docker-service.yaml_

Apply the Kubernetes manifests to create deployments and services by running:

```bash
kubectl apply -f app-world-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f app-world-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f app-docker-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f app-docker-service.yaml
```

#### 4. Access the application

Run the following commands to get the exposed urls for each application:

```bash
minikube service app-world-service
minikube service app-docker-service
```
